# HeadCount 2.0

HeadCount 2.0 is a react app that allows users to view and compare various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district. Users can scroll through visual cards representing the districts then click on up to two cards if they would like to compare data. Currently, HeadCount 2.0 only displays a single page that shows the percentage of kindergartners in a full day program. There are future plans to implement more pages utilizing more data such as enrollment, test scores, dropout rates, graduation rates, remediation, household incomes, and special education. 

## Project Goals

This is a Mod3 Front-End project designed to challenge our skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components using the 'create-react-app' boilerplate. We imported files containing data and treated the data as if it were being fetched from an API. In the spirit of TDD we have were given some unit tests to start off with, then we moved on to creating the rest of the react application on our own, followed by thorough, meaningful, and comprehensinve unit and integreation testing of the application using Jest and Enzyme. PropTypes were also used to validate props passed to each componenet.
